## Creating Packages for KPM

Follow these steps to create a new package for KPM:

1. Create a directory for your package in `packages/`.
2. Add your binaries, scripts, or resources to the package directory.
3. Create a `manifest` file describing your package (name, version, description, dependencies).
4. Test your package locally using KPM's install and remove commands.
5. Submit your package for inclusion in the repository (see [Contributing](../contributing.md)).

**Tips:**

- Keep package names short and descriptive.
- Include a README with usage instructions.
- Check for conflicts with existing packages before submitting.
